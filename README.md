# Everything You Need to Screw Everything Up

This is a skeleton `express` layout to demonstrate how to set CSP headers, get reports, and do CLI stuff. I threw together a couple of quick violations, dropped in a `POST` endpoint for reports, and demoed the routes.

There are better production tools. This is useful for quick tests or understanding how it works.
